## Background
This project was part of my course work while studing for my Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree. The project involved me analyzing data gotten from kaggle. The Medical Appointment No Shows data contains information about patients who scheduled for a medical appointment, some showed up for their appointment and some didn't.
Some of the questions I wanted to answer while analyzing this dataset:
- **Data Source**: Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joniarroba/noshowappointments)
- **Questions to Answer**: 
    - what factors can help determine if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment
    - Are there any correlations between the other features?

## Wrangling Efforts
The data used for this project was relatively clean, and didn't require much wrangling effort. The data had no duplicates and no missing values.
